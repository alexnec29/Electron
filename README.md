# Electron - Electronic Circuit Editor

## Description
During the Introduction to Programming course, I worked on the **Electron project**, an electronic circuit editor designed to allow users to add, remove, rotate, and resize components, create connections between them, and test circuit validity. Components were loaded from text files in a PostScript format, with circuits being saved and loaded as text files. My role involved writing and testing code for circuit control and interaction using C/C++ and troubleshooting technical challenges This experience strengthened my programming skills, deepened my understanding of electronic circuits, and enhanced my ability to collaborate effectively in a small team setting.

## Overview
**Electron** is an electronic circuit editor built in **C++** using **Code::Blocks** and **graphics.h** for rendering.  
Developed in collaboration with a teammate, the project allows users to create and manipulate electronic circuits interactively.  

### Key Functionalities:
- **Add, remove, rotate, and resize electronic components**
- **Create valid circuit connections** (as cables, no current/voltage values)
- **Rename components** and assign values for reference
- **Zoom & rotate freely**
- **Drag the screen** for easier navigation
- **Customize colors via a settings menu**
- **Set cables in 3 distinct phases using right-click:**
  - Cutting middle
  - Reaching **X first, then Y**
  - Reaching **Y first, then X**
- **Supports PostScript-style component design files**

## Features
**Graphical Circuit Editor** – Interactive UI with `graphics.h`.  
**Flexible Component Handling** – Add, rotate, resize, rename.  
**Connection System** – Cables with structured routing.  
**File Support** – PostScript-based component design, save/load circuit files.  
**UI Customization** – Personalized colors via the menu.  

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- **Code::Blocks** with a **C++ compiler** (MinGW recommended)
- **WinBGIm (graphics.h)** installed
